## üéØ Test Results

### Test 1: News Verification (Delhi AQI)
**Claim:** "Delhi's AQI up by nearly 100 points in a day..."

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ GNews API called - returned empty (valid - limited coverage)
- ‚úÖ Fact Check API called - returned empty (valid - no fact-checks yet)
- ‚úÖ **Perplexity API called** - returned comprehensive research with 4 real citations
- ‚úÖ Final report: Verdict "true", Confidence 0.9

**Key Success:** Perplexity now calls actual API instead of hallucinating!

---

### Test 2: Scam Detection (Airtel Phishing)
**Message:** "Binge on blockbuster hits...Airtel Xstream...Click Below!"

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ VirusTotal API called - flagged URL as malicious (1/98 vendors)
- ‚úÖ Sentiment Analysis called - detected "Artificial Urgency" tactic
- ‚ùå **Perplexity API bypassed** - generated fake research (citations may be hallucinated)
- ‚úÖ Final report: Verdict "scam", Confidence 0.9, Risk "high"

**Issue Found:** ScamPerplexityWorker had same problem as NewsPerplexityWorker before fix.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `scam_lane.py` with stronger tool-forcing instructions.

---

## üîß Fixes Applied

### NewsPerplexityWorker (news_lane.py) - ‚úÖ DONE
Added strong instructions:
```
**CRITICAL: YOU MUST CALL THE TOOL**
You do NOT have internet access yourself.
DO NOT generate or fabricate research results.

**YOU CANNOT ANSWER FROM MEMORY**
Even if you think you know, you MUST use the tool.

**BEFORE YOU RESPOND:**
1. Did you call the tool? If NO, STOP and call it now.
2. Did the tool return data? If NO, return the error.
3. Are you adding analysis? If YES, STOP. Return tool data only.
```

**Result:** NOW WORKING ‚úÖ

---

### ScamPerplexityWorker (scam_lane.py) - ‚úÖ DONE
Applied identical strong instructions as news lane.

**Status:** Updated, needs server restart to test.

---

### FactPerplexityWorker (fact_lane.py) - ‚úÖ ALREADY DONE
Updated in earlier fix.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Restart ADK server** to load updated scam lane:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\astra\Desktop\ADk\news_info_verification_v2
   adk web
   ```

2. **Re-test scam lane** with the same Airtel phishing message

3. **Verify logs** now show:
   ```
   [ScamPerplexityWorker] called tool `research_scam_with_perplexity`
   ```
   Instead of:
   ```
   [ScamPerplexityWorker] said: ```json...
   ```

4. **Validate** Perplexity response contains real web research (not hallucinated)

## üéØ Why This Matters

### Before Perplexity Fixes:
- ‚ùå LLM generating fake research from training data
- ‚ùå Citations might be hallucinated
- ‚ùå Missing real-time web information
- ‚ùå No access to current scam reports
- ‚ùå Not actually using Perplexity API despite having API key

### After Perplexity Fixes:
- ‚úÖ Real API calls to Perplexity AI
- ‚úÖ Verified real citations from web
- ‚úÖ Current, up-to-date research
- ‚úÖ Access to latest scam reports and news
- ‚úÖ Actual value from Perplexity API subscription

- **Citations:** 4 real news sources (Hindustan Times, Daily Pioneer, India Today)

### Scam Lane Test (Airtel Phishing):

## üîç How to Verify Fix Worked

### Good Log Pattern (Tool Called):
```
{"parts":[{"function_call":{"args":{"request":"..."},"name":"research_scam_with_perplexity"}}],"role":"model"}
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

### Bad Log Pattern (Tool Bypassed):
```
{"parts":[{"text":"```json\n{\"status\":\"success\"..."}],"role":"model"}
          ^^^^^^
```

## üí° Root Cause Analysis

**Problem:** gemini-2.0-flash is extremely capable and tries to be helpful by answering from its knowledge base instead of calling tools.

**Why it happens:**
- Model has extensive training data about news, scams, fact-checking
- Model thinks: "I can answer this without an API call, that's faster and cheaper"
- Normal instructions like "use the tool" get interpreted as suggestions
- Model prioritizes showing off its knowledge over strict tool adherence

**Solution:**
- Use EXTREMELY explicit, forceful language
- Add multiple warnings and reminders
- Include pre-response checklist
- Emphasize "DO NOT use training data"
- Stress "CURRENT, REAL-TIME" information requirement

**Lesson:** When working with highly capable LLMs, be paranoid about them bypassing tools!
